# Vaccine Slot Checker for Cowin

This is a script made for personal use to check covid vaccine slots on cowin. I usually start this script and keep it running in a terminal whole day
## Setup
* Install Python (>=3.6)
* Edit `config.py` with your details

For playing the notification sound, install playsound library

```pip install playsound```
  
## Run script
```python runner.py```

Hit Ctrl+C or close the terminal to stop the script.

The script will notify you by playing a sound when an 18+ vaccination slot is available.
